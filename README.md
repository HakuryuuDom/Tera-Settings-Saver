## Tera-Settings-Saver 2.0

Tera settings saver is a module for Tera-Proxy which stops your settings from getting reset, aswell as it allows you to easily transfer settings between characters/servers/region. Also for those spicy Caali proxy users, it's auto update compatiable

### How to use:
Command | Usage | Arguments

settings | Transfer settings from another character | File name

#### File name(s) can be found by going to proxy/bin/node_modules/Tera-Settings-Saver/data

### Bugs:
Can potentially reset a glyph & item set page if the settings has been reset(it will print in the chat)
