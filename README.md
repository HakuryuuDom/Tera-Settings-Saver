# tera-keybind-saver 2.0 (not backwards compatible)

No longer have keybinds/glyphs/item binds? randomly reset

Commands:

/8 keybind/key <filename> - This will copy the keybinds from one of your characters, you can find the filenames in tera-keybind-saver/data


Fixed bugs:

Random resets


Known bugs:

If the keybinds reset, there's a chance a glyph page will get overwritten. (it will let you know in chat)
